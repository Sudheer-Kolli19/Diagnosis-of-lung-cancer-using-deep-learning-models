# Diagnosis-of-lung-cancer-using-deep-learning-models
•Designed and implemented a comprehensive pipeline incorporating state-of-the-art image preprocessing techniques,
including histogram equalization, CLAHE, median filtering, and morphological operations. 

• Utilized four pre-trained CNN models (DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG19, and MobileNetV2) to classify lung
tissue images into four categories: normal, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.

• Achieved a Test Accuracy of 85+% with VGG19 and 79+% with Resnet50, outperforming baseline models trained without preprocessing or
enhancement
